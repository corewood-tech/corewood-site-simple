                What if you could ship software faster, more cost-efficiently? How can you reduce technical friction to
                enable interoperability across teams? How can you be sure that your systems are secure?
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                We have the experience and communication skills you need to enable your organization to deliver
                software. We've worked with large enterprises, automating Docker and Kubernetes deployments. We've

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <blockquote>
                What if software projects could run more effectively? How do we know we are solving the right problems?
                What business value are we delivering? These questions drive our approach to software engineering.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Everything about Corewood is "unconventional." We were founded on the idea that software projects can be
                done better. We hop-scotch across technologies, looking to solve underlying problems as effectively as
                possible. Documentation and strategic delivery drive our approach, ensuring that we are solving the
                right problems at the right time. We focus on the "engineering" in software engineering.</p>
            <p>We engineer
                strong communication and feedback loops. Rather than deliver mere functionality, we drive outcomes with
                proven practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our founder, <a href="resume.html">Kyle "Mickey" Mickey</a>, draws from a diverse educational and
                professional background. A
                proven "systems thinker," Mickey has worked on business-critical enterprise platform projects. He has
                also worked on small, fast-moving startup products. He has worked in the energy sector, the financial
                sector, and the public sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical outcomes must be driven by strong communication. By writing and clearly communicating
                expectations, providing timeline and budget transparency, and making implicit assumptions explicit,
                Corewood delivers predictable value to clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                We think big picture. Our work is a small component in a much larger system. We seek to make our
                contributions to the system enabling to stakeholders. Our outcomes must be practical and deliver value
                to our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mickey's passion for the environment and sustainability drives Corewood's reforestation policy: We
                donate 10% of our revenue to rain forest reforestation and regenerative agricultural efforts. We also
                offer a steep discount to companies working in ecotech.

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                We are here to listen and understand your software system needs. Often, when looking for DevOps help,
                organizations face incredible delivery pressure. Systems may have gotten complex or confusing.</p>
            <p>We are
                not here to tell anyone to "do things this way." We don't have prescriptive, one-size fits all
                solutions.</p>
            <p> We want to understand how we can facilitate your organization to deliver the mission-critical
                business value. We are software enablers.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Software exists to solve real-world problems. If we cannot understand the real-world problems our
                solutions must solve, how can we design effective solutions?
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Secure, consistent, and reliable systems emerge from well-designed, simple concepts (models). Our best
                work has seemed obvious in its simplicity. We seek to isolate complexity and optimize for future
                changes.</p>
            <p> We cannot know the future or what requirements it may bring, but we can build a system which is
                extensible and maintainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of the complexity we have seen in software emerges because different contributors hold different
                assumptions. We seek to make these assumptions explicit and to drive outcomes with clear communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                We plan our work and ensure the right stakeholders stay informed every step of the way. We implement
                project management techniques such as critical path analysis and requirements engineering to stay
                focused on delivering outcomes.
