# Overview

This is a business website for Corewood. 

We are a boutique, high-performance inference shop.

We build machine learning inference directly into APIs using compiled, memory-safe languages and fewer components than current industry standards.

# Design

Clean, simple, a little airy

# Content and Tone

Engineering but approachable, knowledgeable but not trying to brag.

# Publishing Blog Posts

To publish a new blog post:

1. Create a new .tsx file in src/updated_website/src/pages/blog/entries/ with the post slug as the filename
2. Structure the blog post following the existing template format (React component with article markup)
3. Include post metadata at the top of the content
4. Register the post in src/updated_website/src/data/blog-posts.ts by:
   - Importing the component at the top of the file
   - Adding a new entry to the blogPosts array with title, date, readingTime, slug, and component
   - Place the new entry at the top of the array for newest posts
5. The date format should be YYYY-MM-DD
6. Restart the development server to see changes
