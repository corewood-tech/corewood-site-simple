              <p>&ldquo;Mickey is a rare kind of visionary because he has an extraordinary ability to understand and realize your vision, and enmesh it within his own. Not only did Mickey take what I had and cleaned it up, but he took my vision and transformed it into something built on a foundation of scalability, security, and agility. The product that emerged is sustainable and positioned for real growth. If you&rsquo;re looking for someone who can take an idea and turn it into a reality that&rsquo;s built to last, I can&rsquo;t recommend Mickey highly enough.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>&ldquo;What makes Mickey invaluable as a technology leader is his ability and desire to see the big picture. In my experience, Mickey&rsquo;s approach to system design has yielded: early delivery, under budget; shared understanding across the team; leveling-up junior team members; detailed documentation that speaks to technical and non-technical audiences; a system that is designed to scale with the number of users, stakeholders and even engineers.&rdquo;</p>
