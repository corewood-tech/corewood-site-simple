                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                            <p>The company needed a way to sell API acccess for money. Business logic was distributed
                                across legacy services with no cohesive way to enable API access and monitor/bill for
                                usage.</p>

                            <p>
                                We knew from previous experience that getting teams to re-implement existing logic in
                                new systems (e.g. Kuberetes containers) would take too long, so we thought creatively:
                                How could we wire up a single API to look like it was the same product, despite
                                different backing services?</p>
                            <p>
                                Designed an event-driven API gateway configuration engine. Thoroughly documented and
                                socialized a conceptual solution that stakeholders could understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Co-led a team of engineers, advocating for best-practices and focusing on the
                                interaction between systems. We handled the identity management and permissions
                                enforcement, enabling other teams to prioritize functional business logic.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The company was able to go-to-market with visibility into system configuration details.
                                Our monitoring worked well and we were able to see who accessed which APIs and which
                                credential holder should be billed for the usage.

                            <p>
                                The technical details go deep for this solution. We needed to configure legacy devices,
                                add new devices, and manage the identity model for the device.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                After doing some research on available tools and pricing, the easest solution was not
                                cost-effective. We had to build semi-custom software on top of API Gateway. This proved
                                easy with authorizer Lambdas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ended up building an identity and management model, with corresponding diagrams and
                                proof-of-concept implementation, which would grow to support IoT devices at scale.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The company was able to shut off legacy systems after migration IoT device identity
                                handling to the new system.

                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                A cryptocurrency conference hosted in Denver, Colorado, needed a ticketing and payment +
                                registration system. Existing off-the-shelf solutions did not accept cryptocurrency
                                payments.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                            <p>By using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, the solution integrated with SaaS payment
                                processors.</p>
                            <p>For credit card transactions, we used <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>, and
                                for cryptocurrency transactions we used <a
                                    href="https://cryptwerk.com/company/globee-com/">Globee</a>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The conference was able to sell tickets and accept payments in multiple forms.
