            <p>
                Microservices enable teams to build and deploy software independently. This includes many benefits,
                like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="unlink"></i>Greater autonomy between teams</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="cable"></i>Fewer obvious dependencies</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="arrow-up-down"></i>Ability to scale specific services up / down
                    based on demand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But.. as microservices develop independently, so too does the idea of "what the software does." I'll
                share an example: OAuth2 has the concept of "scopes." Applications can choose how to use scopes. They do
                not tend to scale well because each application develops its own use of scopes, and scopes <em>mean
                    different things to different microservices!</em> This can cause problems downstream, but the bigger
                points is that services' idea of "how to use scopes" changes. These sorts of little inconsistencies make
                systems difficult to change all at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Legacy software. Legacy software got built for reasons that the org may or may not worry about today.
                But the clients use the legacy systems, and some critical bits of business logic are rattling around in
                there. But the legacy systems... they do not reflect where things are going.
            </p>
            <p>
                When dealing with microservices and legacy systems... How do you create a consistent external-facing
                look-and-feel? Does pagination work the same way? Do I get consistent error message formats between
                endpoints? Do the endpoints have consistent documentation?
            </p>

                We built a system that handled all of the API-things, enabling development teams to do the rest.
            </blockquote>
            <p>The API things include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="fingerprint"></i>Identity</li>

            <p>The level-of-effort of getting all the microservices to adopt the standards and practices set by the org
                cannot scale!</p>
            <p>What if one system handled <em>all of those things?</em></p>
            <p>But how do you on-board microservices?</p>
            <h3>Thinking Big Picture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="shield"></i>Secure</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="orbit"></i>Consistent</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="activity"></i>Reliable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We stepped back and looked at the system from a conceptual point-of-view.</p>
            <blockquote>
                By thinking about the "bigger picture" and business impact of an "API Product," we realized that we
                could reduce complexity and increase the speed of development.
            </blockquote>
            <p>What makes operating an API product hard?</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="chart-spline"></i>Change over time</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="user-cog"></i>User Access & Management</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="waypoints"></i>Endpoint Configuration</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="git-merge"></i>Underlying service issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address these issues, we broke the system into two components. Taking inspiration from Kubernetes and
                networking equipment, we defined a "control plane" and a "data plane."</p>
            <p>The control plane handles specific events, and when a set of predefined conditions gets met, the control
                plane triggers changes in the <em>data plane.</em></p>
            <p>The data plane handles the internet -> API routing. It includes firewalls, bot detection, caching,
                monitoring and alerting, authentication / authorization, and proxying to the correct underlying host.
            </p>

            <h3>Code-as-Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Most of the time, data-plane concerns get handled using infrastructure-as-code. This is where a an
                engineer updates code files and triggers infrastructure changes. This is great, and is the solution that
                works for most use cases.</p>
            <p>However, when engineers have to handle configuration changes based on business events, it can take a long
                time for the changes to get done. To expedite this, we decided to handle infrastructure change events as
                code.</p>
            <p>As a result of these decisions, we ended up with a system which was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="cog"></i>Automated -- The control-plane enabled us to trigger
                    asynchronous updates, such as endpoint deprecation.</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="spline"></i>Flexible -- The control-plane validated changes and
                    could be updated / tested without impacting client-facing traffic.</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="blocks"></i>Extensible -- New handling could be added to the
                    system.</li>
                <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="lock-keyhole"></i>Secure -- Separate internal and external
                    security protocols.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Legacy and nascent services were able to consistently and reliably expose API endpoints. Using async
                events, other stakeholders were able to review API documentation prior to release.</p>

        <h1><i class="heading-icon" data-lucide="telescope"></i> OpenTelemetry Collector</h1>

        <p><a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</a> provides a vendor-agnostic approach for collecting operational data.</p>

        <p>Using OpenTelemetry requires a "collector." The collector receives data from the application. We were asked to provide a low-config, universal configuration for applications to submit telemetry data.</p>

        <p>Referencing <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/gateway/">OpenTelemetry Documentation,</a> this pattern is called a "Gateway Deployment."</p>

        <h2><i data-lucide="cloud"></i> Hybrid-Cloud Solutions</h2>

        <p>We deployed an internally-available Kubernetes service and configured a private domain name specific to the collector. The domain resolved across AWS and GCP cloud networks.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            We provide consistent solutions that work for all of the applications in the ecosystem.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Our resulting configuration was:</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="file-text"></i> Well-Documented</li>
            <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="server-cog"></i> Automated</li>
            <li class="service-item"><i data-lucide="activity"></i> Monitored</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We provided teams with comprehensive documentation on submitted data via OpenTelemetry, and we provided example dashboards of the resulting telemetry.</p>

        <h1><i data-lucide="mails"></i> Invitation Service</h1>

        <p>Despite the best efforts of countless professionals, <em>sometimes things slip through the cracks.</em> While replacing a legacy identity service, a dependent service discovered that they used an "add user by email" function. This was a problem, because the new system was "sign-up-and-enroll." We needed users to <em>enroll</em> themselves rather than "get-added" so that the user consented to join the system.</p>
        
        <p>But the dependent service had a valid use-case: they had business logic which needed to execute prior to the user's login.</p>
        
        <h2><i data-lucide="mailbox"></i> By Invitation Only</h2>

        <p>By capturing these business requirements in a single, isolated system, we minimize the integration changes needed by ecosystem services. At Corewood, we always focus on how our choices impact not just the current system but options for future development as well.</p>
