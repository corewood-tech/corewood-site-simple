                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Vision vs. Reality</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Imagine this: Your company invested millions in cutting-edge AI capabilities. The leadership team was sold on transformative potential. Six months in, your data scientists have built impressive models that perform beautifully in isolation, but getting them to actually drive business value has become a nightmare of integration challenges.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Sound familiar?
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This is the story playing out across enterprises today. Companies have acquired powerful AI capabilities but can't effectively harness them because of fundamentally flawed system architectures.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">A Tale of Two Approaches</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Consider these contrasting scenarios:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    <strong>Company A</strong> followed the conventional wisdom: They built a complex ML pipeline with specialized components for data processing, model training, and inference. Each component runs on separate infrastructure with its own monitoring systems. Their architecture diagram looks impressive with dozens of boxes and arrows connecting various systems.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    When they want to deploy a new AI feature, it takes three months of integration work across five teams. The model itself was ready in two weeks.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    <strong>Company B</strong> took a different approach: They built their ML capabilities directly into their core business systems. Models are served through streamlined APIs that interface directly with application logic. There's no separate "AI infrastructure" – just business systems with embedded intelligence.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    When they identify a new opportunity for AI, they can go from concept to production in weeks, not months.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">What Went Wrong?</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The conventional ML architecture that Company A followed creates a fundamental disconnect between the intelligence (the model) and the actual business processes it's meant to enhance.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This disconnect shows up as:
                </p>

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Architectural Bloat</h4>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    In today's typical ML deployment, we're dealing with a sprawling stack:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>User-facing application</li>
                    <li>Application APIs and specialized data stores</li>
                    <li>Internal service APIs</li>
                    <li>Data transformation pipelines</li>
                    <li>Inference orchestration layer</li>
                    <li>Model serving infrastructure</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Each layer adds complexity without adding intelligence.
                </p>

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Integration Tax</h4>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Every boundary between components requires:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>Data transformations and validations</li>
                    <li>Additional infrastructure provisioning</li>
                    <li>Cross-team coordination</li>
                    <li>Complex deployment processes</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This "integration tax" often costs more time and resources than the actual model development itself.
                </p>

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Innovation Paralysis</h4>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    When your brightest minds are spending their time maintaining a complex system rather than solving business problems, innovation stalls. The technical debt of maintaining these disconnected systems becomes overwhelming.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">A Better Way Forward</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The solution isn't better components – it's fewer components. By integrating model inference directly into business systems, companies can:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>Eliminate unnecessary handoffs between systems</li>
                    <li>Reduce infrastructure complexity and costs</li>
                    <li>Deploy new AI capabilities in days rather than months</li>
                    <li>Free technical talent to focus on innovation rather than integration</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This approach requires rethinking assumptions about how AI systems should be built. It means abandoning the idea that ML components need their own specialized infrastructure separate from business systems.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">Taking the First Step</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Ask yourself these questions about your own organization:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>How many teams need to coordinate to deploy a new AI feature?</li>
                    <li>How long does it take to move from a working model to production implementation?</li>
                    <li>How much of your ML budget goes to infrastructure rather than intelligence?</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    If you don't like the answers, it might be time to reconsider your approach to AI architecture.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The most successful companies in the AI era won't be those with the most sophisticated models – they'll be those who can most effectively integrate intelligence into their core business processes without unnecessary complexity.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The choice is clear: continue building complex AI systems that look impressive on architecture diagrams but deliver slowly, or adopt a streamlined approach that delivers business value faster with less overhead.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The future belongs to those who choose simplicity and integration over complexity and separation.
