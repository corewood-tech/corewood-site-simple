                What does that take, really? If we take a bunch of really smart people and put them together, maybe it will work? Surely the open-source tooling is the best possible thing on the market, and even if it's not, we can't afford to invest in activities that don't build our business or aren't our core competency…

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                What if I told you: Building AI systems that deliver real business value requires navigating a complex landscape of technical considerations that directly impact your bottom line.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Let's talk about common pitfalls that derail even well-funded AI initiatives.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Hidden Infrastructure of Successful AI Implementation</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                WARNING: OVER-LEVERAGED HOUSE ANALOGY INCOMING.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                If making AI systems were like building a house, the models and algorithms are just the visible structure. But the foundation, plumbing, and electrical systems determine whether your house stands for decades or collapses after the first storm. Or 2nd. Or 3rd. There are lots of storms coming.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                What good is rolling out an AI initiative, only to discover six months in that your system can't be deployed because it fails basic security requirements? Many companies have watched in frustration as cloud costs spike. Like hard… because the AI system wasn't designed for efficiency.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                These scenarios happen more often than not because companies focus exclusively on data science (and, let's face it—hype) while neglecting the critical infrastructure that determines whether AI delivers lasting value.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">Beyond Models: The Business Foundations of AI Success</h3>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">Security That Enables Rather Than Blocks</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                If a marketing team develops an AI-powered customer analysis tool they can't actually use because of security concerns, who is winning? If it can't be done securely, it can't be done. Sorry.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                When security is built into your AI strategy from day one, you avoid this deadlock. How differently would projects progress if business teams and security teams were aligned from the start? They could even leverage security frameworks that enable innovation while maintaining protection…
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">Build to SCALE</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                We have been living in a fantasy. "If we can prove out the value we can get the funding to fix…" That used to be true, but not with AI systems. You can't afford to build an AI system twice.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                A properly architected AI system scales predictably. What if you could double your user base while seeing only a 20% increase in infrastructure costs because your system was designed for efficiency from the beginning? It's possible.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">Data Governance That Protects While Enabling Innovation</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Consider the healthcare executive who must choose between innovation and compliance—their AI vendor wants data access that would violate patient privacy regulations.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                How much easier would it be with AI systems operating within your existing security boundaries, allowing you to innovate without compromising compliance? This isn't just about avoiding problems—it's about accelerating innovation.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">AI Selection Based on Business Outcomes, Not Hype</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Did you know "AI" is actually a whole array of technologies? Using OpenAI (or even the latest, greatest open-source model) may not be right for your use case.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Picture a company investing millions in the latest large language model only to discover that a simpler, specialized approach would have been more accurate for their specific use case while costing 80% less. Their competitors will be happy with the free vicarious learning experience.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                The right AI approach matches technology to specific business requirements.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Think about how your ROI would improve if every AI investment was sized appropriately for its actual business application rather than following industry hype cycles.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">Systems Built for Evolution, Not Replacement</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                How quickly do business requirements change in your industry? You don't want an AI system that becomes obsolete whenever requirements shift. Design needs to consider extension and modification.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                A properly designed AI ecosystem adapts as your business evolves.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">Ongoing Performance That Doesn't Degrade</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Ok, let's say you're an investor, investing in an AI system that performs brilliantly at launch but gradually deteriorates as market conditions change, eventually becoming a liability rather than an asset.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                With proper monitoring and maintenance processes, AI systems maintain their value over time.
            </p>
