                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The AI industry has been promising the world for years now. Artificial General Intelligence. Self-driving cars. Automated healthcare. Smart cities. Yet despite billions in investment and endless hype cycles, we're still waiting for many of these promises to materialize.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Why is this happening? And more importantly, what can forward-thinking businesses do about it?
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Great ML Disconnect</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The current machine learning landscape suffers from a fundamental misalignment:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-medium">
                    <strong>What we're building:</strong> Massive, general-purpose models requiring extraordinary computational resources.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-medium">
                    <strong>What businesses actually need:</strong> Efficient, targeted solutions that solve specific problems with reasonable resources.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This disconnect creates a cascade of problems that directly impact your bottom line:
                </p>

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Resource Problem</h4>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Today's approach to machine learning is the computational equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>Unnecessarily complex systems consuming excessive energy</li>
                    <li>Premium hardware running basic preprocessing tasks</li>
                    <li>Inflated cloud computing costs that keep executives awake at night</li>
                    <li>Environmental impacts that contradict sustainability commitments</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Diminishing Returns Problem</h4>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    We're witnessing a clear asymptote in AI development. Despite doubling parameters and computational resources, performance gains are flatlining. The "bigger is better" approach has hit its ceiling, yet companies continue pouring resources into this diminishing returns trap.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Corewood Approach: Targeted Intelligence</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    At Corewood, we've pioneered a fundamentally different approach to machine learning implementation:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Strategic preprocessing at the API level</strong> - Moving tensor manipulations and data preparation to appropriate system layers</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized, purpose-built models</strong> - Replacing general-purpose AI with targeted solutions</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource-optimized architecture</strong> - Using premium computational resources only where actually needed</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    This approach delivers what matters: faster implementation, lower costs, reduced environmental impact, and solutions that directly address your specific business challenges.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Future Belongs to the Efficient</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    While industry giants continue chasing diminishing returns with increasingly resource-intensive models, businesses working with Corewood gain immediate advantages:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li>40-60% reduction in computational costs</li>
                    <li>Significantly faster inference times</li>
                    <li>Solutions aligned with specific business objectives</li>
                    <li>Sustainable AI implementation that scales with your business</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">Breaking Through the ML Ceiling</h3>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The machine learning industry is experiencing its own version of the law of diminishing returns. Throwing more resources at the problem isn't working. The future belongs to companies who recognize this fundamental truth and pivot to efficiency-focused, brain-inspired approaches.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Corewood specializes in delivering cutting-edge machine learning solutions that others can't even conceptualizeâ€”not because we use more resources, but because we use them intelligently.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                    Don't let your business become another casualty of the AI hype cycle.
