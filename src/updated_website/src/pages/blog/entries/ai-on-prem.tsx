            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Current State of AI Integration</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                The business world has become obsessed with integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into their operations—and for good reason. AI promises improved efficiency, deeper insights, and competitive advantages in nearly every sector. But there's a critical disconnect between this promise and its implementation.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Most organizations approach AI adoption through a standard playbook: find a third-party SaaS provider with pre-built AI capabilities, sign contracts for their services, and start sending your business data outbound for processing. It's the path of least resistance, seemingly allowing companies to leverage sophisticated AI without building internal expertise.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                This approach introduces a cascade of challenges that many leadership teams don't fully consider until they're already knee-deep in implementation:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Data transmission vulnerabilities</strong>: Every time your data leaves your environment, it creates new security and privacy risks</li>
                <li><strong>Performance bottlenecks</strong>: External processing creates latency and throughput limitations</li>
                <li><strong>Hidden integration costs</strong>: Connecting disparate systems requires significant engineering resources</li>
                <li><strong>Operational dependencies</strong>: Your critical business functions become reliant on another company's infrastructure and priorities</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance complications</strong>: Data sovereignty and regulatory requirements become exponentially more complex</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">Why Organizations Default to This Model</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Companies continue down this path despite these challenges for several understandable reasons:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Perceived expertise barriers</strong>: Many believe that building internal AI capabilities requires specialized talent that's impossible to find or retain</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure misconceptions</strong>: There's a widespread assumption that AI requires massive, specialized hardware investments</li>
                <li><strong>Time-to-market pressure</strong>: External solutions offer the appearance of faster implementation</li>
                <li><strong>Technology separation</strong>: AI has been artificially segregated as something fundamentally different from other computing tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                This separation is the key misconception that drives unnecessary complexity. The truth is more straightforward: AI inference is computation—specialized computation, certainly, but still just code execution. And code can be optimized, integrated, and deployed wherever it creates the most value.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Architectural Reality</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                When organizations rely on third-party AI providers, they're essentially building a system that looks like this:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Business data exists in internal systems</li>
                <li>Data is extracted, transformed, and transmitted to external providers</li>
                <li>External systems process the data using AI models</li>
                <li>Results are transmitted back to internal systems</li>
                <li>Internal systems interpret and integrate these results</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Each of these steps introduces potential points of failure, security vulnerabilities, performance limitations, and engineering complexity. The architecture creates artificial barriers between business logic and AI capabilities that don't need to exist.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The On-Premises Alternative</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                At Corewood, we've developed a fundamentally different approach. By embedding AI capabilities directly within the same business systems that already handle your data operations, we eliminate the artificial separation that creates so much unnecessary complexity.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Our technology allows AI processes to run locally, in your existing environment, with direct access to your data where it already lives. This isn't about making minor improvements to the standard approach—it's about reconceptualizing how AI integrates with business systems.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                The result is an architecture where:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>AI capabilities become just another function within your existing systems</li>
                <li>Data remains in your environment, processed where it already lives</li>
                <li>Processing happens locally, eliminating transmission overhead and vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>The same teams that manage your other business systems can manage your AI capabilities</li>
                <li>Scaling follows the same patterns as your other computing resources</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Business Impact</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                This architectural shift delivers transformative advantages:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Enhanced security posture</strong>: Dramatically reduced attack surface with no data transmission required</li>
                <li><strong>Improved performance</strong>: Lower latency with direct data access and no network bottlenecks</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced engineering overhead</strong>: Simplified integration with existing systems and workflows</li>
                <li><strong>Greater operational control</strong>: Full visibility into system operation and decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Streamlined compliance</strong>: Data remains within your existing governance frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Resource optimization</strong>: Less infrastructure required to accomplish the same work</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-900">Making the Shift</h3>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                The transition to on-premises AI isn't just a technical decision—it's a strategic realignment that puts control back where it belongs: in your hands. By treating AI as an integrated capability rather than an external service, organizations can unlock AI's potential without compromising on security, performance, or control.
